🌦️ Weather App — Part of the Daily Dashboard Project

This project is a React + Vite weather application that provides real-time weather updates for any city in the world.
It is one component of my larger Daily Dashboard project — a personal productivity platform that integrates daily tools like weather updates, motivational quotes, and personal mood tracking.

The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time data and displays temperature, humidity, and weather conditions with a dynamic video background for an engaging user experience.
